LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell R1/Q[4]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) R1/Q_reg[0]/CLR, R1/Q_reg[0]_lopt_replica/CLR, R1/Q_reg[0]_lopt_replica_2/CLR, R1/Q_reg[1]/CLR, R1/Q_reg[1]_lopt_replica/CLR, R1/Q_reg[1]_lopt_replica_2/CLR, R1/Q_reg[2]/CLR, R1/Q_reg[3]/CLR, R1/Q_reg[4]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
